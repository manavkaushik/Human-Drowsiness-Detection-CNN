# Human-Drowsiness-Detection-CNN

The fatalities occuring in car accidents due to drowsiness, drunkenness, or fatigue have been on a steady rise over the past several years. This calls for a pre-installed security system in our vehicles which can alert the driver/ rider about his/ her drowsiness state just by capturing the face of the driver for a few seconds. This project is aimed at solving the same problem through an innovative and contemporary approach: Video Classification using **Convolution Neural Networks**. </br>

We developed a Deep Learning model (using Convolutional Neural Network & Transfer Learning) to detect signs of drowsiness in car drivers.
Our data comprised of recorded videos of drivers in different light intensities which is fed to the model after augmentation & pre-processing.
The fnal fne-tuned model(with VGG16 weights pre-trained on ImageNet dataset), achieved an accuracy of over **72%**
